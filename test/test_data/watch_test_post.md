Hi there, this seems to be a text containing just a url: [Halloween Tree Climbing: Hanging Mr. BoneJangles (Casey Snyder)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwwM443zMAk&t=299s),
and here we observe an actual [markdown hyperlink]( https://youtu.be/MQwVktMGjN0?t=79 ). Or again as a url,
[Hangin' the Hammock (Casey Snyder)](https://youtu.be/MQwVktMGjN0?t=79), starting at a certain time, or not [Hangin' the Hammock (Casey Snyder)](https://youtu.be/MQwVktMGjN0).

This confuses it, because we don't know when we're done. Still the resulting url seems to work: [Halloween Tree Climbing: Hanging Mr. BoneJangles (Casey Snyder)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwwM443zMAk&t=299s?)
This does, though: [Halloween Tree Climbing: Hanging Mr. BoneJangles (Casey Snyder)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwwM443zMAk&t=299s) ?
