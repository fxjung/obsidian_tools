Hi there, this seems to be a text containing just a url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwwM443zMAk&t=299s,
and here we observe an actual [markdown hyperlink]( https://youtu.be/MQwVktMGjN0?t=79 ). Or again as a url,
https://youtu.be/MQwVktMGjN0?t=79, starting at a certain time, or not https://youtu.be/MQwVktMGjN0.

This confuses it, because we don't know when we're done. Still the resulting url seems to work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwwM443zMAk&t=299s?
This does, though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwwM443zMAk&t=299s ?
